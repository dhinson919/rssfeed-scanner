# IQVIA Python Interview Test #

- <b>What is this?</b>
	- This is the result of a Python technical evaluation I was asked to perform by IQVIA on Friday Sept 25 2020 as a prerequisite for an interview with a software engineering team in their Analytics Center of Excellence.  It came after a month of other preliminary conversations via email, text and phone.  I was given the following two days (a weekend) to complete it.  As explained to me there was an urgency to complete it due to the desire to conduct the team interview someday during the following week.
<br><br>
- <b>What was the assignment?</b>
	- Distilled to its essence:
		- "Given a tuple of Disease and RSS feeds, determine which disease had no activity for a given number of days."
		- "Please upload to GitHub and send us a link."
<br><br>
- <b>So how did it do?</b>
	- Unfortunately I will never know.  Despite meeting the deadline and the other requirements I heard nothing more about it.  At the end of the next week I contacted the inside recruiter who I had been working with to ask what had happened.  I was told sorry, the team had decided to proceed with a different candidate.  Fine, I said, but then why the urgency with this work?  Did they think I had nothing better to do with my weekends?  And <i>why was I having to contact them</i> to learn about the decision?  You've been treated no differently than the other candidates was the only cogent response.

- <b>Can I use this code to help with my own IQVIA interview test?</b>
    - If you find it helpful in some way, by all means.  One should never plagiarize of course, but I leave it here in the public domain for the education of others.  How you apply it is your concern.
<br><br>
- <b>But doesn't this violate some kind of code of ethics?</b>
    - Not at all.  It is my work written on my time under the employ of no one.  There was no NDA involved, and the fact that the result is publicly published here, a code sharing service, was per IQVIA's  actual instructions.
<br><br>
- <b>Wait.  Are you saying that after a month of back-and-forth with IQVIA, you were told that a weekend assignment was a pre-requisite for an interview the following week, and then after completing it as requested they decided not to extend the interview to you and then did not even have the courtesy to notify you about it?</b>
    - That's right.   Not even a "thanks anyway".  As remarkable as it seems there are still large, modern and otherwise successful companies that are not above operating in this haughty and boorish way.
<br><br>
- <b>Maybe your code is just scary bad!</b>
    - Well I don't think that's the case, and I have no evidence that they even took the time to look at it.  But I'll let you be the ultimate judge.
